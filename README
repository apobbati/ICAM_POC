This development environment is based on Vagrant and Salt

You can read more about the docs online.

TO INSTALL THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Have patience
    - Be connected to a fast internet connection (for downloading dependencies)
    - Run the following commands:
        - mvn clean install
        - vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
        - vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
        - vagrant plugin install vagrant-salt
        - vagrant up

        At the end of 'vagrant up', you will need to provide your password for updating the /etc/hosts file
        so the VMs can be addressed by their domain names.

There are three virtual machines in all:
    - OpenAM            http://sso.acorn.ads.example.com:8080/openam
    - UserAcctMgmt      http://useracct.acorn.ads.example.com:8080/
    - ExternalApp       http://externalapp.acorn.ads.example.com:8080/

By running 'vagrant up', there are a list of dependencies that will be downloaded, and configured
    to make the above configuration work.


COMMON VM COMMANDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - To start all VMs (If you haven't performed the install, see above instructions):
        - vagrant up
    - To suspend all VMs:
        - vagrant suspend
    - To shutdown all VMs:
        - vagrant halt
    - To restart all VMs:

    - To destroy all VMs: (!!!! BE VERY CAUTIOUS !!!!!)
        - vagrant destroy

        - vagrant ssh <vmname>

        The following vnames are defined:

            - useracctmgmt
            - externalapp

            Example usage: 'vagrant ssh externalapp'
